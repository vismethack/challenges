# ECMWF Hackathon 2022: Visualising Meteorological Data - Challenges

The aim of the #VisMetHack @ECMWF 2022 is to explore how meteorological data, weather and climate, can be visualised to be more **useable, understandable and impactful** for users and the broader public.

This is not your usual Hackathon. We are looking for a wide range of experience to help with the challenges, ideas and projects. If you are a coder, designer, data wrangler, meteorologist, storyteller, journalist... or just have an interest in meteorological data and visualisation this is the event for you.
